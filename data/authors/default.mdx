With a background in professional services, I bring a unique blend of expertise in project management,

AI, DevOps, and business strategy. My career has spanned industries from Wealth Management to Capital Markets,

where Iâ€™ve led complex projects and delivered tailored solutions for clients. Now, I focus on the

intersection of people, processes, and technology, helping businesses navigate the evolving landscape

of AI and software engineering. My blog is dedicated to sharing insights and strategies that drive business growth,

streamline operations, and embrace technological innovation.
