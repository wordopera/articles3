# AI Trends in Compute: Executive 1-pager

## Innovations and Trends

### Data Centres

- Traditional data centers, built for cloud-scale operations, are insufficient for generative AI models.
- The demand for processing power is skyrocketing, necessitating liquid cooling infrastructure, larger and taller racks, and upgraded electrical distribution systems.

### Quantum Computing

- Nations like the US and China are competing to be the first to achieve a usable quantum computer.
- Quantum computing promises to revolutionize fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and scientific simulations by solving problems too complex for classical computers.

### AI-Driven Chip Design

- Leading technology companies are using AI to optimize chip design, tackling issues of cost, speed, and power efficiency.
- This approach could disrupt the semiconductor market, giving innovators a competitive edge and fostering advancements in AI-dependent sectors.

## Opportunities

### Data Centres

- Companies that invest early in AI-optimized data centers gain a competitive advantage due to the rising demand for high-performance computing environments and limited data center space.

### Quantum Computing

- Companies investing in quantum-resistant cryptography and quantum machine learning could excel in data security and drug discovery, leading to competitive advantages and new business opportunities.

### AI-Optimized Chips

- As AI spreads in enterprise applications, businesses can modify their software and operating systems to support AI-optimized chips and mobile devices. This could enable more powerful and efficient AI-driven solutions across various industries.

## Issues

### Data Centres

- Resource constraints, particularly the availability of GPUs, data center space, and AI expertise.
- The transition to high-density AI data centers requires costly and complex infrastructure adjustments, posing financial and logistical challenges for operators.

### Talent Shortage

- The global semiconductor industry faces a shortage of skilled workers, hindering onshoring initiatives and the development of advanced computing technologies.
- Addressing this talent gap through workforce development programs and immigration reforms is crucial.

### Geopolitical Tensions

- The race for technological supremacy, particularly in quantum computing and semiconductors, fuels geopolitical tensions and protectionist policies.
- This could stifle global collaboration, leading to a potential "tech cold war" and hampering progress in these critical fields.
