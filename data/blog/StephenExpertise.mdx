# Stephen's Expertise: Project Management, Marketing & Technology

## Solving Complex Business Problems

Stephen has the experience to solve your most difficult problems. He developed logical thinking skills early on, studying decision making when resources are scarce, which earned him a degree in Economics. Before leaving University, Stephen spent a co-op year in the Marketing department of Apple Canada, conducting original research related to advertising and the dealer sales channel.

## Execution, Technology, and Marketing

Working in product development, Stephen learned about creating new categories, fast-failure, hyper-fast development cycles, and data mining. This blend of project execution, technology, and marketing positioned Stephen perfectly to manage cross-functional teams. As he worked on marketing strategy positioning, Stephen realized that both Marketing Managers and Project Managers share a common role—they are the hub of the wheel, coordinating the spokes of Marketing, Sales, Legal, Operations, Technology, and more.

## Sweet Spot: Strategy Informed by Technology

Stephen found his sweet spot—the discipline of execution grounded in strategy and informed by technology. This allowed him to collaborate with large international companies, both on-site and remotely, on various high-impact projects.

## Competitive Advantage through Project Management

Stephen embraced Project Management as a competitive advantage for companies. The benefits he brought to the table included faster time-to-market, improved teamwork, increased project success rates, and enhanced cohesiveness among diverse teams. Stephen's leadership of successful projects—such as developing a Call Centre, coordinating a billion-dollar Merger & Acquisition, and launching a major Brand in the Energy sector—earned him a North American Innovation Award. He also received a global award for Marketing work in the Texas market.

## Integration Professionals

In 2008, Stephen launched **Integration Professionals**, where he has been working as a solo practitioner ever since. Word of mouth and referrals are his primary sources of new work, though new clients and challenges are always welcome.

## Emergency First Aid & Volunteer Work

In addition to his professional accomplishments, Stephen has embraced volunteer work. He has provided athlete first aid at high-risk sports events during the Pan-Am Games, and during the winter, he has been seen performing on-snow rescues and administering emergency aid.
