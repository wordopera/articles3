- Hotels like the Marriott International are using facial recognition for seamless check-ins, enhancing security and customer convenience.

### Operational Efficiency

- AI systems predict equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and repair costs. Hilton uses IBM's IoT solutions for this purpose.
- Robots like the LG CLOi guide and clean rooms, ensuring consistent quality and freeing staff for more complex tasks.

## Opportunities

### Enhanced Customer Engagement

- AI systems like Alexa for Hospitality allow guests to control room settings with voice commands, creating a more personalized experience.

### Operational Cost Reduction

- AI optimizes energy consumption, reducing costs and environmental impact. AccorHotels implemented AI-driven energy management systems, resulting in significant savings.

### Data-Driven Decision Making

- AI tools like ReviewPro analyze guest feedback from multiple sources, providing actionable insights to improve services and facilities.

## Issues

### Data Privacy Concerns

- With AI systems collecting vast amounts of personal data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations is crucial. As new AI laws are introduced worldwide, staying up to date with them is not an easy task. Mishandling data can lead to severe legal and reputational consequences. For example, Meta is facing challenges in Brazil and the EU.

### Integration Challenges
