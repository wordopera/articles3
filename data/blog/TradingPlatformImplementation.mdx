# How a $30M Trading Platform Overcame Challenges and Succeeded

## The Situation

A leading Belgium-based financial institution faced a critical challenge with a stalled $30 million project aimed at implementing a new derivatives trading system. The project encountered significant obstacles including specialized subject matter expertise decreasing staff morale and high turnover rates which collectively led to an operational standstill. This situation threatened the institution's ability to manage funds on behalf of its institutional clients effectively.

## The Intervention

In response, the institution adopted a strategic approach to revitalize the project, led by Stephen. Recognizing the project's complexities, Stephen recommended a temporary halt to reassess and restructure the team's composition and leadership. This approach included recruiting additional full-time support from the vendor, reintegrating former team members, and refining the leadership dynamics across the global teams located in Toronto, London, Paris, and Luxembourg.
Emphasizing cultural awareness and communication, Stephen spearheaded efforts to rebuild team morale through enhanced collaboration, regular team meetings, and recognition events. This reinvigorated approach focused on prioritizing critical work areas such as Derivatives Workflow, Reporting, Trade Capture, Pricing, and Accounting, addressing significant gaps and issues head-on.

## Project Result

The intervention's success was not just in reviving a stalled project but in significantly enhancing the financial institution's market standing and operational efficiency.

- Competitive Edge Enhanced: The implementation of the new trading system markedly improved the institution's offerings, positioning it favorably against major competitors such as BNY, J.P. Morgan, and State Street.
- Pricing Reliability and Efficiency: There was a noticeable improvement in the reliability of pricing, which is crucial for derivatives trading, ensuring more accurate and trustworthy financial operations.
- Optimized Processing: The project achieved improved straight-through processing, streamlining operations and reducing the risk of errors and delays in transactions.
- Cohesive Team Formation: A significant outcome was the re-building of a robust working team equipped not only to implement the new system but also to transition smoothly to operational support post-launch. This ensured the sustainability of the project's success and laid a solid foundation for future initiatives.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR EXECUTIVES

- The importance of adaptive leadership and cultural sensitivity in global project management.
- Strategic team restructuring and focused problem-solving can overcome substantial project hurdles.
- Building a cohesive team is as critical as technical success in long-term project viability and competitive differentiation.
