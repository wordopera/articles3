# AI Trends in Robotics and Drones: Executive 1-pager

## Innovations and Trends

### Collaborative Robots (Cobots)

- Work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety.
- Perform repetitive and hazardous tasks, allowing human workers to focus on complex activities.
- In 2024, ABB's YuMi cobot series expanded with the introduction of the YuMi Pro, designed for electronics assembly. This cobot features enhanced vision systems and machine learning algorithms for improved adaptability in complex manufacturing environments.

### General-Purpose Robots

- Capable of performing a variety of tasks, from domestic chores to industrial operations.
- Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid robot showcased significant advancements in 2024, demonstrating the ability to perform a wider range of tasks, including basic construction work and emergency response activities.

### Autonomous Drones

- Equipped with advanced sensors and AI algorithms for navigation and task performance.
- Applications include agricultural monitoring, disaster response, package delivery, and infrastructure inspection.
- Amazon's Prime Air drone delivery service expanded to several major U.S. cities in 2024, utilizing AI for route optimization and obstacle avoidance in urban environments.

### Drone Swarms

- Multiple drones operating in coordination to complete tasks efficiently.
- The U.S. Department of Defense successfully tested a large-scale drone swarm for reconnaissance missions in 2024, using advanced AI algorithms for coordination and decision-making.

## Opportunities

### Automation of Tasks

- Increased efficiency and reduced operational costs.
- Drones for aerial surveys and inspections save time and resources.
- In 2024, Shell implemented autonomous robots for offshore oil rig inspections, reducing human exposure to hazardous environments.

### Data Collection and Analysis

- AI-powered robots and drones gather vast amounts of data for valuable insights.
- Improves decision-making, product development, and customer experiences.
- John Deere's autonomous tractors, equipped with AI-powered sensors, collected and analyzed soil health data across millions of acres in 2024, providing farmers with actionable insights to optimize crop yields.

### Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS)

- Enables companies to use advanced robotics without significant upfront investments.
- Facilitates adoption by small and medium-sized enterprises.
- Fetch Robotics expanded its RaaS offerings in 2024, introducing a new line of warehouse robots that small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses could lease on a per-use basis, significantly reducing upfront costs.

## Issues

### Regulatory Frameworks

- Need for robust regulations to ensure safety, privacy, and security.
- Concerns about air traffic management and privacy violations with widespread drone use.
- In December 2023, the European Union introduced the "AI Act," provisionally agreeing to regulate the development, deployment, and use of AI-powered robots and drones across member states.

### Workforce Displacement

- Risk of job displacement in industries reliant on manual labor.
- Necessity for upskilling the workforce to transition smoothly to an automated environment.
- A 2020 report by the World Economic Forum estimated that robotics and AI would displace millions of jobs globally by 2025, highlighting the need for large-scale reskilling initiatives.
