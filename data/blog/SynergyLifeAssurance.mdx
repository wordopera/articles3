# Synergy in Life Insurance Acquisition

## The Situation

A large bank acquires a manufacturer of life insurance to extend its overall wealth offerings and acquire both a customer base and a sales group. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the experienced management team from the acquired insurance company identify additional synergy opportunities based on the new combination. However, despite having the Board of Directors' support, there are challenges. The bank's existing capital, accounting, and operational policies are tailored to traditional banking, making integration difficult.

## The Intervention

An insurance company has high cash inflow from policyholders. Given the bank's vast real estate holdings and credit risk appetite, the approach is to shift holdings from short-term (cash) to long-term assets. A detailed plan is developed to identify, invest, and lease back several hundred million dollars in real estate. A key benefit of this strategy is the actuarial impact of Asset Liability Matching, which positively influences the bank’s financial metrics.

Stephen and the CFO assemble a team of internal and external experts. The team includes the Chief Accountant, Appointed Actuary, Tax and Legal experts, outside counsel, and appraisal professionals. A clear explanation of the business case, risk profile, and active communication with management stakeholders help remove blockers and gain internal support.

## The Result

As the first transaction unfolds, word spreads within the bank, and more experienced and expert partners join the team. The first transaction becomes a template for replicating the business case several times. The success of this initiative is evident in the following year’s financial results, leading to:

- Increased Net Income After Taxes (NIAT) and reduced policy liabilities
- Reduction in interest rate volatility
- Increased Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirement (MCCSR) ratio

Following the success of the first two transactions, Stephen transitions the “playbook” to the remaining internal team, allowing them to continue replicating this initiative as a Business As Usual program.
