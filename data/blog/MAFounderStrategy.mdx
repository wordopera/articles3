# How Strategic Planning Led to 5x Revenue Growth for a Managed Firm

## Situation

A Toronto-based Managed Services firm, with $1.8M in annual revenues, lacked an exit strategy. Intent on exiting within 3-8 years, the owner and staff were consumed by daily operations, limiting their capacity for strategic change.

## Intervention

Key initiatives targeted included horizontal acquisitions, online sales and customer service enhancements, social media branding, ERP implementation for financial reporting, and strategic leadership hires.

## Results

The intervention transformed the company within nine months:

- Revenue Increase: Three acquisitions resulted in a 5x revenue increase by acquisition.
- Digital Enhancement: Website redesign decreased customer inquiry 35% in 3 months.
- Brand Visibility: Social media campaigns improved brand presence in 3 three months.
- Operational Efficiency: Implementing a finance ERP module streamlined financial processes and improved record organization.

## Executive Takeaways

- Strategic Planning: Essential for businesses eyeing an exit, demonstrating the value of careful planning and execution.
- Flexibility: Prioritizing strategic initiatives based on their impact and feasibility is key.
- Leveraging Technology: Digital marketing and ERP systems can significantly enhance scalability and efficiency.
